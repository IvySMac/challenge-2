      <p>Hello! My name is Ivy McCurdy. I am a concept artist and illustrator with a background in animation. I strive to familiarize myself with a wide variety of tools to help me become a well-rounded artist. I have become versed in programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Maya, ZBrush and much more! With a unique mix of traditional and digital mediums under my belt, Iâ€™ve been having fun creating unique pieces of artwork.</p>
      <p>
        Ever since I was little and could pick up a pencil, I have been breathing life into characters and stories. Whenever I had free time, I had my face pressed to a sketchbook. When I graduated high school, I went on to the University of Kansas to study fine arts before realizing my true passion was in animation. Two years later I transferred over to Johnson County Community College where I graduated later in the Fall of 2018. 
      </p>
        <p>As of 2023, I have moved on to the world of Full-Stack Development to help round out my skills as a creator. To take a look at some of my most recent projects, click on the 'Work' link above.
