# Challenge 2

## Description
Now that I have some tools under my Full-Stack Developer belt, I can now use that to create my very first portfolio! This portfolio will section out into three main bodies of content-'About Me', 'Work', and 'Contact Me'. 

## Usage

![a portfolio website with a header that reads 'Ivy McCurdy' to the left and navigation links on the right. Under it has the word 'About Me' to the left with a block of text and a photograph of a person making a peace sign with their fingers](./images/screenshot.jpg)

The primary objective of this challenge will be to create interactive images and links that will better help guide future employers toward my work and my socials.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

```
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

```
